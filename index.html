<p>
The idea of having a blog has been in my mind for a long time.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I had a blog prior to this one, which was built on top of
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jekyll</a>. To be honest, I have tried Ruby many times, but have never
felt like it was something for me, or maybe I haven't really spent
enough time to discover what it has to offer.
</p>

<p>
Either way, I find Ruby and Jekyll to be a little annoying to install
and mantain, which is why my old blog was left unmantained.
</p>

<p>
In this blog post I'll describe some of the features I search for, and
why I chose Hexo.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">What I'm looking for</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
As I said before, I'm not much of a Ruby guy, I spend my days writing
Javascript and Python for the most part. I've lately become very
familiar with the workflow of these programming languages and their
tools.
</p>

<p>
I'm also a heavy Emacs user, and thus I prefer to use org-mode for
writing documents and whatnot. It is by far better than markdown, I'm
really used to it and the fact that it can be parsed and exported
makes it a very versatile markup language for emacs users.
</p>

<p>
So, in the end, what I wanted was a blogging system that allowed me to
write my posts in org mode, preferably not having to export it to
anything, and I wanted this system to <b>just work</b>.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, Jekyll was not it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
I will say once again that <b>I'm not a Ruby guy</b>.
</p>

<p>
I'll just list the problems:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>After every Ruby update, gems had to be reinstalled, because the
path to gems got broken.
</li>
<li>I had to either write markdown or export an org file to Jekyll, save
it and rename it.
</li>
<li>I had to manually set the date in the file name for every post.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
My problem was mostly with the second point, because I believe that
having to mantain two copies of files is a little moronic, to say the
least.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">The paradigm shift</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This past week, Mike Zamansky released a <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-35-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="external">blog post and video</a> on how he
blogs, explaining why he moved away from Jekyll to <a href="https://getnikola.com/blog/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Nikola</a> and it made
so much sense to me, because i was having the same problems with it.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, on one project I'm working on, we decided to move
some code away from jQuery to AngularJS, and to manage our
dependencies with <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/" target="_blank" rel="external">yarn</a>. To be honest, I've never been prone to change,
but this change to AngularJS made me think about how the Front-End
community is gravitating toward Javascript and RESTful services. I
hear there's even backend servers for Node.JS.
</p>

<p>
So, in short: The Web development community is gravitating towards
javascript (at least in this era) and we should use the tools we feel
the most comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
And so I thought: yeah, let's ditch Jekyll and let's build something
on top of Javascript.
</p>

<p>
I have to say I am <b>very</b> comfortable with Python as well, but I feel
like I should really get into the Javascript world.
</p>

<p>
That's when i discovered Hexo. A quick search in Google led me to
<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">StaticGen</a>, which pointed me to Hexo.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Moving to Hexo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
<a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a> is a static site generator built on top of Javascript that
provides every feature I ever desired for a static site generator,
<i>and more</i>.
</p>

<p>
With it I can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write every post with org mode and just be done with it.
</li>
<li>Deploy to github effortlessly.
</li>
<li>Manage it from Emacs.
</li>
<li>Learn some Javascript.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And, of course <b>it doesn't break</b>.
</p>

<p>
I'll shortly describe what I've added to Hexo to make it work with
Emacs and org-mode.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Emacs workflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I'm sure someone else can explain better how to install Hexo, so I
won't go over that. Instead, I'll describe how to set up org mode and
Emacs to work with this awesome static site generator
</p>

<p>
I installed the org mode parser:
</p>

<pre class="example">
yarn add hexo-renderer-org
</pre>

<p>
Which lets me write every post with org-mode and Hexo will properly
generate the site without me having to export my org mode files.
</p>

<p>
And, the one I believe is the killer, is <a href="https://github.com/kuanyui/hexo.el" target="_blank" rel="external">hexo.el</a>, an extension for
Emacs which allows me to manage all of my Hexo site from within
Emacs. Hell, I don't even need a shell for this now.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
While I think I still have some time to get used to this, Hexo looks
very promising as a static site generator for Emacs users. The worflow
features a very rich management environment provided by hexo.el and a
very solid org mode parser which allows its user to write posts using
Emacs org-mode.

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        

<p>
I recently got my hands on a brand new <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/review/laptops/asus-zenbook-ux303u-review-3632053/" target="_blank" rel="external">Asus Zenbook UX303</a> and it
looks quite nice. So I did the first thing I wanted to do with it
right away: <b>Install Arch Linux</b>. Yeah, I've been using Arch for quite
a bit now on my desktop PC and I fell in love with it from the very
first time I used it. No PPA nonsense, easy development and, to be
honest, I'm quite used to its workflow.
</p>

<p>
Since the laptop came bundled with Windows, there was some work to
do. I downloaded Arch Linux, made a bootable USB Flash Drive using
<a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="external">Rufus</a> and started with the installation right away. The guide can be
found on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide" target="_blank" rel="external">Arch Wiki</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">UEFI on Arch</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The process is quite straightforward if you read carefully. I got kind
of stuck at this because, well, I like to do the process fast, but it
can't always be like that.  <b>Do <i>not</i> forget to use <code>gdisk</code> for GPT
partitions</b>.
</p>

<p>
Also, some little but useful pointers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The boot partition has to be <i>EFI System Partition</i>, which has code <code>EF00</code>.
</li>
<li>This partition also has to be set to <code>FAT32</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The rest is easy, just follow the guide. Nothing out of the
ordinary. I'm sure people explain this better on youtube.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">GNOME</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I've been using GNOME for quite some time and I'm quite happy with
it. There are some critical extensions that have to be installed to
make it usable but that's ok. I'll write about it some other time.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, not everything works out of the box here, most of it is on the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">ArchWiki</a>. I'll explain what i went through.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">WiFi</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
WiFi is quite a pain to configure without a GUI. You need sudo and it
gets kind of annoying. Just install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager" target="_blank" rel="external">NetworkManager</a>, set it up (in GNOME
gets as easy as just starting a service) and be done with it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Bluetooth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Same thing here. Just <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="external">follow the wiki</a>, install the packages, enable
the service. Done.
</p>

<p>
You might want to get this right in order to share Internet Connection
with your cellphone. I have a Galaxy A5 2016 and it works flawlessly.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">The rest</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
I had no problems with anything else. The rest of the stuff should
work out of the box.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Hardware</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This is the point where things get tricky. It took me quite a while to
figure these issues out, and thats what made me want to do this post.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Keyboard.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
I'm quite fond of the keyboard in this model though it could be nicer
to have media keys. While the keyboard in this model has a lot of
keys, I only find important to be able to control screen brightness,
keyboard backlight and volume. I haven't really tested anything else.
</p>

<p>
The Keyboard brightness and Volume keys worked right out of the box
for me, as did the disable touchpad button. Unfortunately, i can't say
the same thing about the brightness keys, as they do <b>not</b> work out of
the box. It's not so bad though, because GNOME's user panel <b>can</b>
control the screen backlight, which provides an usable workaround.
</p>

<p>
I did a little research and it turned out my ACPI was working, it was
just that the OS couldn't handle the keys. Long story short, adding
these options to my kernel made my backlight keys work:
</p>

<pre class="example">
acpi_osi= acpi_backlight=none
</pre>

<p>
With <code>systemd-boot</code>, you have to append the text to the <code>options</code>
line. In my case, it was the file
<code>/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf</code>. <code>acpi_osi=</code> makes the keys work but
they don't do anything, and <code>acpi_backlight=none</code> rebinds everything
to the <code>backlight_intel</code> interface.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">GPU</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
GPU is probably the most tricky feature to set up in this model.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee" target="_blank" rel="external">The ArchWiki</a> has an article on how to set up Bumblebee in order to get
the best of both worlds: Integrated graphics and dedicated video
card. I must say I gave it endless tries to get it working and it -to
some extent- does work. But only until i close the laptop. It then
becomes unusable.
</p>

<p>
I still have problems with this, so i won't be advising on this
matter. I will say, though, that gaming on a 14 inch laptop is not
really the best setup. I still have my desktop for that.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">Battery discharging</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
I found out some months after I wrote this post, that nothing gets
restored after the battery dies.
</p>

<p>
Honestly I don't really want to test this feature, because bad things
can happen: my battery can reduce its life or I might not get it to
work on the first time. I can live with it, though, because the
battery duration is quite good.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
After months of using this laptop I have to say it is one of the
smoothest computers I've ever used, it rarely freezes and it doesnt
really overheat. Trying Linux on this laptop is definetly worth a
try. I've been using it for around 9 months now and have barely had
any problems
